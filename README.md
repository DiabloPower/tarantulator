## Description

This mod adapts the **Tarantulator** created by [notnotmelon](https://mods.factorio.com/user/notnotmelon) and brings it to the next level of functionality and compatibility with **Factorio 2.0**, including the Space Age expansion.  

### **Mod Features**
- **Deadly**: The Tarantulator features a **Railgun** that destroys/kills mostly everything in its way with one Shot.
- **Reliable**: It also got more **Health** (5k) and Damage **resistances** than an ordinary Spidertron.
- **Nuclear Powered** "burner" Engine that also powers the Equipment Grid.
- **Enhanced Control**: Introduced remote driving capability to operate the Tarantulator from a distance.  
- **Logistics Network Integration**: Fully compatible with Factorio's logistics network for automated supply deliveries.  
- **New HD Graphics**: You've never looked better while wiping out those pesky Biters!
